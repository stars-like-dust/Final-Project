If you end your training now — if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did — you will become an agent of evil.,,,,,,,
You must unlearn what you have learned.,,,,,,,
No. Not yet. One thing remains. Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will,,,,,
Train yourself to let go… of everything you fear to lose,,,,,,,
Always pass on what you have learned,,,,,,,
Feel the force,,,,,,,
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering,,,,,,,
You will know when you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack,,,,,
Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind,,,,,,
Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you,,,,,,
No longer certain, that one ever does win a war, I am. For in fighting the battles, the bloodshed, already lost we have. Yet, open to us a path remains. That unknown to the Sith is. Through this path, victory we may yet find. Not victory in the Clone Wars, but victory for all time
Remember, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware anger, fear, and aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke… do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father’s fate you will,,,
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering,,,,,,,
Padawan, thousands of Jedi once there were. Then came war. In our arrogance, join the conflict swiftly we did. Fear, anger, hate. Consumed by the dark side, the Jedi were,,
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way,,,,,,
Hmm. Darker the coming storm grows. I fear the dark cloud of the Sith shrouds us all,,,,,,,
Luke, when gone am I… the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is… another… Sky… walker,,,,
Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained,,,,,,,
Wrong? Hmm. A long time, fought I did. Consumed by fear, I was, though see it I did not,,,,
Patience you must have my young padawan.,,,,,,,
Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice
Yes, afraid. Hmm, surprised are you? A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger,,,,
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away… to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless,,,,,
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not,,,,,,,
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will,,,,,
Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is,,,,,,
Destroy the Sith we must,,,,,,,
Ahhh! Yoda’s little friend you seek,,,,,,,
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is,,,,,,,
