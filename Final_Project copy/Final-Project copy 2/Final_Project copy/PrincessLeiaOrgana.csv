Princess Leia Organa,,
"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope",,
"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader’s leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board",,
Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper,,
Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way,,
"Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy",,
"Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking, Nerf-herder",,
Would it help if I got out and pushed,,
Stop that. My hands are dirty,,
I hope you know what you’re doing,,
"You have your moments. Not many of them, but you do have them",,
We have powerful friends. You’re going to regret this,,
"You’re a jittery little thing, aren’t you",,
"She was very beautiful. Kind, but sad",,
"I know. Somehow, I’ve always known",,
"Oh, it’s not like that at all. He’s my brother",,
Same jacket,,
I just never should have sent him away. That’s when I lost him. That’s when I lost you both,,
"No matter how much we fought, I’ve always hated watching you leave.” — Leia to Han as he departs for Starkiller Base",,
"If you see our son, bring him home",,
May the Force be with you,,
