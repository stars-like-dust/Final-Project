Princess Leia Organa,,
"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope",,
"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board",,
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper,,
Will someone get this bik walking carpet out of my way,,
"Someone has to save our skins. Into th garbage chute, fly boy",,
"Why, you stuck up half-witted, scruffy looking Nerf-herder",,
Would it help if I got out and pushed,,
"Sotp that,  My hands are dirty",,
I hope you know what you are doing,,
"You have moments, not many of them, but youdo have them",,
We have powerful friends You're going to regret this,,
"You're a jittery little thing, aren't you",,
"She was a very beautiful, kind, but sad",,
"I know, shomehow I've always known",,
"Oh, it is not like that a all He is my brother",,
same jacket,,
I just never should have sent him away That is when I lost him That is when I lost you both,,
NO matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave,,
If you see our son bring him home,,
May the force be with you,,
